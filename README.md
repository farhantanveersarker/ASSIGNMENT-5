# ASSIGNMENT-5



WShapes
Overview
The Shapes project is a Java application that models various geometric shapes and calculates their properties such as area and volume. This project demonstrates the principles of object-oriented programming, including inheritance and polymorphism, by defining a base Shape class and extending it to represent specific shapes.

Features
Shape Hierarchy: A base Shape class with derived classes for specific shapes:

Circle
Rectangle
Square
Pyramid
Cylinder
Sphere
Calculations:

Area: Implemented for shapes like Circle, Rectangle, and Square.
Volume: Implemented for 3D shapes like Pyramid, Cylinder, and Sphere.
Class Structure
Shape.java: Abstract base class defining common attributes and methods for all shapes.
Circle.java: Represents a circle and includes methods to calculate its area.
Rectangle.java: Represents a rectangle with methods to calculate its area.
Square.java: Represents a square (a special case of a rectangle) with area calculation.
Pyramid.java: Represents a pyramid and includes methods to calculate its volume.
Cylinder.java: Represents a cylinder with methods to calculate its volume.
Sphere.java: Represents a sphere and includes methods to calculate its volume.
Main.java: Contains the main method to demonstrate the functionality of the various shape classes.
Usage
To run the application:

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Anjal-Poudel/Shapes-lab5.git
Navigate to the project directory:
cd Shapes-lab5
javac *.java
java Main
The Main class demonstrates the creation of different shape objects and outputs their calculated properties.
